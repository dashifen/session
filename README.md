# Dashifen/Session

A few years ago, I built this object for use in a larger project.  It sat within that project and gathered dust since then.  But, it was pretty useful, so I decided to extract it into its own package.  Maybe it'll only be useful to me, but who knows!

**NOTE**: this is not (at this time) intended to be an implementation of \SessionHandlerInterface.  Instead, it's just a way to make $_SESSION feel a little more object oriented and a way to avoid messing with the superglobal within code if you don't want to.
